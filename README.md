# DEPRECATED

Please use the wonderful and active https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr project.

## Nostr types for Rust

- [x] create event 
- [x] serialize event
- [x] deserialize event
- [ ] handle tags
- [ ] subscribe to relays
- [ ] put relays in pools

try `cargo run --example demo` if you want to see what's up. You'll need a relay running at `ws://localhost:3333/ws`
